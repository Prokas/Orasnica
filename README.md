Note: This project is still a work in progress, and some changes might occur.

The keyboard you see here is inspired by the Grumpy model, particularly its format.
Big thanks for the inspiration, and a special shout-out to our colleague @il for helping refine the ideas.

Brief Specifications:

**PCB:**
	â€¢	Flexcut
	â€¢	Hotswap
	â€¢	32 keys with support for 2 encoders
	â€¢	Coin battery or lithium battery
 	â€¢ MCU : Nice Nano V2.0 

**Case:**
	â€¢	Gasket mount
  â€¢ Two part, easy print.
	â€¢	7% tilt
  â€¢ Wristrest
(If youâ€™re wondering why the wrist rest has a hole, thatâ€™s because itâ€™s designed to function as a pen rest.)
*_The switch for powering on and off hasnâ€™t been completed yet, which is why thereâ€™s just a hole there for now. Thatâ€™s one of the things that still needs to be finished._

Required Parts:
**	1.	Gasket tape:**
	â€¢	Thickness: 3 mm
	â€¢	It is used to dampen vibrations and achieve better sound and feel while typing.
  â€¢ You can stick the gasket tape directly onto the plate or the caseâ€”itâ€™s up to you.
(I prefer sticking it onto the plate since I often change cases, but the plate stays the same.)
	**2.	Screws:**
	â€¢	Number of screws: 7 pieces.
	â€¢	Dimensions: 3 mm x 20 mm (slightly shorter screws are also fine).
	â€¢	Recommendation: Use the screws from the link provided, as they have been tested.

_ Note about screws:_
	â€¢	Directly into plastic: Screws can be inserted directly into plastic parts, but this might reduce the durability of the joints.
	â€¢	Durability tips: It is recommended to use inserts for 3D-printed parts to increase strength and longevity.
	â€¢	Recommended inserts: Use brass or steel inserts compatible with plastic parts.

Thank you! ðŸ˜Š
